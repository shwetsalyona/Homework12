        <h2 class="title">Introduction &nbsp;<span class="sup-text title-sm">Chapter 1</span></h2>
        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
            they've
            moved to <a href="#" class="link">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
            documentation, Native
            Components, React, and
            more!</p>
        <h2 class="title">core components &nbsp;<span class="sup-text title-sm">Chapter 2</span></h2>
        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
            platform‚Äôs
            native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
            describe
            the
            appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
                    class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn more
            about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>
        <h2 class="title">react fundamentals &nbsp;<span class="sup-text title-sm">Chapter 3</span></h2>
        <p>React Native runs on <a href="#" class="link">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user
            interfaces with
            JavaScript. To make the
            most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as
            a
            refresher course.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p><b>+ components</b>. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
            friendly, approachable creatures that
            need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
        <p><b>+ JSX</b>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
            JavaScript like so:
            <span class="bg-gray">&#60Text&#62Hello, I am your cat!&#60Text&#62</span>
        </p>
        <p>The React docs have <a href="#" class="link">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn even
            more.
            Because JSX is
            JavaScript, you can
            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="bg-gray">name</span> for the cat, name, and
            embedding
            it with curly braces inside
            <span class="bg-gray">&#60Text&#62</span>
        </p>
        <p><b>+ props</b>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
        <p><b>+ state</b>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
            components
            render, state is like a
            component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
            from
            user
            interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>
        <h2 class="title">handling text input &nbsp;<span class="sup-text title-sm">Chapter 4</span></h2>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                class="italic">onChangeText</span>
            prop that takes a function
            to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called
            when
            the
            text is submitted.</p>
        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
            this
            new
            language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
            translated as
            "üçï
            üçï".</p>
